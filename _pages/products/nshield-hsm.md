# nShield 5c HSM

Deliver cryptographic key services to applications with Entrust crypto-agile, highly scalable, next-generation hardware security modules (HSMs).

nShield 5c HSMs are security appliances that deliver cryptographic services to applications across the network, in the cloud, and in hybrid environments. The hardened, tamper-resistant, FIPS 140-3 level 3 certified* platforms perform such functions as encryption, digital signing, and key generation and protection. With their comprehensive capabilities, flexible hybrid deployments, quantum crypto-agility, and 100% compatibility with existing nShield HSM deployments and APIs, these HSMs can support an extensive range of applications, including certificate authorities, code signing, and more.

*FIPS 140-3 Validated, Certificate #4745


# Entrust nShield 5s HSMs

nShield 5s HSMs are PCIe cards that perform encryption, digital signing, and key generation for an extensive range of commercial and custom-built applications, including certificate authorities, code signing, and more. With their comprehensive capabilities and quantum crypto-agility, they are 100% compatible with existing nShield HSM deployments and APIs, and they are highly secure, with FIPS 140-3 Level 3 certification*.

*FIPS 140-3 Validated, Certificate #4745

# nShield Edge

The nShield Edge hardware security module (HSM) is a full-featured, portable USB HSM designed for low-volume transaction environments. Itâ€™s capable of encryption and key protection and is ideally suited for off-line key generation for certificate authorities (CAs) as well as development and Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) environments.

# nShield as a Service (nSaaS)

nSaaS is a subscription-based solution for generating, accessing, and protecting cryptographic key material, separately from sensitive data, using dedicated FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified nShield Connect HSMs. The solution delivers the same functionality as on-premises HSMs and the benefits of a cloud service deployment, without the need to host and maintain the appliances.
